                            Under his aegis the company has seen tremendous change in last few years due to change of business strategy from mid level housing to luxury housing. Nayan Raheja was front runner in getting the world’s largest construction companies i.e. Arabtec and ECC to India under joint venture as a part of back-ward integration of the company. He was also instrumental in appointing Thornton Tomasetti U.S.A., the structural engineers of Kingdom Tower (1Km high, tallest under construction building in the world), The Petronas Towers, Malaysia & Taipei 101, Taiwan. Overall, the results are visible and company is adding turnover and brand value and has a great future ahead.
